# Contributing to compose

Right now, compose is a very small project, and I don't think it warrants a lot of weighty processes. If you have any idea or suggestions, feel free to:

  - Open an issue to discuss
  - Open a pull request and assign me (@davidhollis)
  - Reach out to me personally [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/david_hollis) or [via email](mailto:compose-project@davidhollis.net)

**The most important thing** to note is that the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies to all interactions in the compose community. I care deeply about creating a kind, open, and welcoming environment around this project. Harrassment of any kind will not be tolerated.


## Contributing financially

While I appreciate the thought, there are numerous other organizations doing great work that could use the money more than I could. Consider donating instead to one of the following:

  - [The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund](https://www.naacpldf.org/about-us/), dedicated to the pursuit of racial justice through education and legal advocacy.
  - [The Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/about/), providers of crisis intervention services for LGBTQ+ or questioning youth.
  - [Unloop](https://www.un-loop.org/about/), who offer software development training and job placement for recently incarcerated people in Washington State.
